## Enables fast evaluation via a JIT compiler.  This is exposed in the
## [`fidget::jit`](crate::jit) module, and is supported on
## `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-*`, and
## `x86_64-unknown-linux-*`.  There's no way to disable the feature on other
## platforms ([Cargo issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1197));
## users will have to disable it manually via `default-features = false`.
jit = ["dep:dynasmrt", "dep:libc"]

## Enable [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/) bindings, in the
## [`fidget::rhai`](crate::rhai) module
rhai = ["dep:rhai"]

## Enable 2D and 3D rendering, in the [`fidget::render`](crate::render) module
render = []

## Enable 3D meshing, in the [`fidget::mesh`](crate::mesh) module
mesh = ["dep:crossbeam-deque"]

## Enable `eval-tests` if you're writing your own evaluator family and want to
## unit-test it.  When enabled, the crate exports a set of macros to test each
## evaluator type, e.g. `float_slice_tests!(...)`.
eval-tests = []

## On Linux, this feature uses `mprotect` to prevent JIT buffers from being both
## writable and executable at the same time.  This is best practice from a
## security perspective, but incurs a 25% slowdown.
